# MoveIt

[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/528c952731a691bba909c22b0b7fbe62/m "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/528c952731a691bba909c22b0b7fbe62)

We, @multunus, love giving it back to the community. Also, we are concerned about
the wellbeing of people who work with us. So we asked our people to "move it" and
we donate some amounts to charities, based on their workout. Isn’t it interesting?

So how do we keep track of these workouts? While we were conducting a Hacknight
(night long fun coding event), some of our guys came up with this awesome system,
no wonder called MoveIt.

MoveIt not only stores your workout details, it also lets you keep a track of
other people’s activities and what charities were affected by your movements. It
has progressed over time, and now has web, Android and iOS interfaces with edge
technologies like Rails and React.

Please read on for the Rails backend setup. You can refer [this repo](https://github.com/multunus/moveit-shared-client)
for web client, [this repo](https://github.com/multunus/moveit-react-native) for
Android client and [this repo](https://github.com/multunus/moveit-ios) for iOS client.
